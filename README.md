## üßê Idea <a name = "Idea"></a>

This project focuses on implementing features that would make the life of the busiest working professionals easy in today's tech-savy world.
The whole project can be mainly divided under 3 umbrellas :- events, a to-do app and health focused features

The TO-DO app includes 3 features:-

- add task
- edit task
- clear task

Under the EVENTS umbrella,the following features are included:-

- Geting Google Calendar events and displaying them in the form of a table(includes permission to access your calendar as well)
- Productivity Analysis- Using the starting and ending time of meetings in the whole day to show a pie chart indicating the proportion of meeting hours and productive hours(total working hours - meeting hours)

The heath focussed features are as follows:-

- Integrating the app with a smart-watch and display a sleep cycle(sleeping hours while working on each project)
- Sending timely notifications reminding the person of lunch time,sleep time etc.

## üé• Progress so far <a name = "progress_so_far"></a>

- The first umbrella which is the TO-DO app has been implemented successfully.
- Under the events' umbrella, all the features have been implemented on the dashboard.
- Google Calendar Api is used for authenticating the app as soon as one goes to the table dashboard so that the user can grant permission to the app to access their calendar events.
- These events' details(meeting name,date,start time,end time and meeting link) are displayed on the dashboard in the form of a table.
- I have used dummy data and implemented the logic behind the pie chart for the productivity analysis.
- Sleep cycles would need data from smartwatches which would need authorization from the manufacturers, so I have rather used dummy data

## üí≠ How it works <a name = "working"></a>

- The TO-DO app uses state managament in REACT to retain the data for the tasks.
- The Google Calendar API sends a GET request to fetch all the scheduled events in the user's calendar and sends to the frontend to be displayed in the form of table
- The start and end timings of meetings are used to calculate the productive hours which is displayed in the pie chart as a percentage of the total working hours.
- The sleeping hours for each project are displayed in the form of bar graph.

## ‚õèÔ∏è Built Using <a name = "built_using"></a>

This app has been built using the MERN stack, mostly REACT and a little bit of Flux for the front-end.

## üéà Sample dashboard <a name = "sample_dashboard"></a>

## ‚õèÔ∏è Debugging and Maintanence <a name="debugging_and_maintanence"></a>

- The data used in pie-chart is dummy data but given more time, the data fetched using the Google Calendar API can be used.
- Currently, the app asks the user to grant permission every time one clicks on Tables tab.

## Performance and Scalability <a name="performance_and_scalability"></a>

- The site works on all the web browsers.

## ü§ì Future Work

- Notifications can be sent to the user reminding them of timely meals and breaks
- Integration of the web app with smart-watch can be a large scale future work which would need authorization from the side of manufacturers
- A small feature in the to-do app to set the priority of tasks (low,medium,high)
- A voice assistant service which works to play music, read out the news etc.
